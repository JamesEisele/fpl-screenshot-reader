# FPL Screenshot Reader

*Under development*

The purpose of this package is to convert FPL screenshots into text for further team analysis.

## Ideas

- Using a free tier of ocr.space: http://ocr.space/
- Using Python with CV2 (filter by background) and PyTesseract
- Using tessaract.js: https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/
